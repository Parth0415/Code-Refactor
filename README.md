## Refactor the code of both HTML AND CSS

My motivation was to build this website more responsive, easily accesible and fun looking for users by applying my learning skills which i learned during first week of course. 

I build this project for better practice of what i learned during my first week and also, to show my skills publically to everyone by pushing my work to github repository.

Problems which i solved to make my website look more functional are:
1) add some attributes to the link to make it more functional.
2) removed non-semantic elements ```div``` and added some semantic elemnts such as ```<section>```,```<main>```,```<aside>```which makes sense for users and device to understand the codes and tried to make it more cleaner.
3) commented on both HTML and CSS file for users to understand what and why are the changes made to make and look website more functional.

By building this project i learned some new skills which contains:

1) Started thinking as an developer and focus more on a computational thinking and try to understand more about what are the acceptance criteria of the story and what the user wants.
2) Learned and applied CSS skills to the website.
3) Learned how to use professional site github to upload all your work and projects which reflects your skills in terms of portfolio.
